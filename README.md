# gaming rig

Cloud gaming provided by yourself.

## before you start

you have to **create an AWS account** if none exists yet.

You need to install `awscli` and `terraform` to create the `gaming rig`.

### use asdf for the ease of use

You can use the tool version manager `asdf` for installing.

* awscli
* terraform
* jq

Install `asdf` according the [documentation][1]

For the **first time run** you need to add the needed **plugins** by

```
$ asdf plugin add awscli
$ asdf plugin add terraform
$ asdf plugin add jq
```

Then you can install the needed **plugins** by executing

```
$ asdf install
```

### other requirements

You also need

* wget
* curl
* tar
* awk

and the **DCV viewer** for accessing your instance

### install DCV viewer

In the `./dcv` folder you can find additional information about installing the viewer.

After the gameserver is provisioned, you can use the **DCV viewer** to connect to your gaming rig.

## start the rig

You can start the rig by

```
$ make up config
```

After about **2 minutes** the instance should be reachable via **rdp**.
About **10 minutes** later, the instance should be provisioned.

Now you can use the DCV client to connect.

A `./config.dcv` file is generated with all necessary information to
connect to the instance.

```
$ make connect
```

will connect you to the instance.

On the Desktop you can find an `provisioning` folder, which contains some log files about the provisioning.
You can easily delete this folder if you like.


## troubleshooting

When you getting errors during requesting a spot instance, you can
**increase your bet** by setting the `increase_bet_by` variable.

If no instance is available in your availability zone, you can
choose **an other availability_zone** by setting the `availability_zone` variable.
The availability zones are stored within an array.
The count of these vary from region to region.
The first zone found is the default one.

I have some **mouse issues** during gaming.
There is a mouse setting available (Ctrl shift F8) to use the relative mouse position.

### Snapshot

When you shutdown your server, all data is gone.
You could create a snapshot manually, but this can be automated.
