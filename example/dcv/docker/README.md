# DCV Client Dockerfile

You can download the DCV client for many platforms.

For those who use Gentoo, for example, it may be easier to use the docker variant.


```
$ make
```

will build the `nice_dcv_client` container with **current logged in user data**.

```
$ make run
```

Will start a **temporary container** for the DCV client.
