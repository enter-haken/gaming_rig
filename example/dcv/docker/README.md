# DCV Client Dockerfile

You can download the DCV client for many plattforms.

For those, who are running Gentoo for example, it might be easier to use the Docker variant.

```
$ make
```

will build the `nice_dcv_client` container with **current logged in user data**.

```
$ make run
```

Will start a **temporary container** for the DCV client.
